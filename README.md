- [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iQSxeITqinF4uMLNu_7g_kzoWqu3uQFXI2OkkkBcdjc/edit?usp=sharing)

This project investigated how K means, K medians and K mediods differ.

The dataset used to test these algorithms was self created.

After the data set was sent through the algorithms I utilized matplot to create graphs showing the different clusters 

I outlined the shape each cluster made and then used Polygon import to find the area of each cluster.

### Findings:

Each type of clustering algorithm was different from the others.

The choice of which algorithm to use then comes down to the problem and which one suites the problems needs the best.
